        The keys in the dictionary represent the names of the settings. The
        values are a dictionary comprised of 3 additional key/value pairs.

        * ``type``: The type of the setting. This should correspond to one of
          the data types that toolkit accepts for app and engine settings such
          as ``hook``, ``template``, ``string``, etc.
        * ``default``: The default value for the settings. This can be ``None``.
        * ``description``: A description of the setting as a string.

        Example implementation:

        .. code-block:: python

            @property
            def settings(self):

                    }
                }

        The settings are exposed via the ``settings`` key as the plugins are
        configured via the ``publish_plugins`` setting in the app's
        configuration. Example::

            publish_plugins:
                - name: Export and Publish
                  hook: "{config}/export_and_publish.py"
                  settings:
                      Publish Template: export_template
                      Resolution: 2048x1556

        The values configured for the plugin will be supplied via settings
        parameter in the :meth:`accept`, :meth:`validate`, :meth:`publish`, and
        :meth:`finalize` methods.

        The values also drive the custom UI defined by the plugin whick allows
        artists to manipulate the settings at runtime. See the
        :meth:`create_settings_widget`, :meth:`set_ui_settings`, and
        :meth:`get_ui_settings` for additional information.
